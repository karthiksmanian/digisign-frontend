# Digisign

The point of making this app is to avoid redundancy in dowloading the PDFs, instead we maintain a single shared instance which can be downloaded at a later stage once the requested people have signed the doc.

## Workflow

1. **Sign Up**: Create an account/SSO in with Google on our platform.
2. **Upload a PDF**: Upload the PDF document you want to sign collaboratively.
3. **Invite Collaborators**: Invite others to view and sign the document.
4. **Sign the Document**: Apply your signature and see the real-time updates as others sign.

## Demo Video
